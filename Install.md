# Welcome to the install guide

If you use an apt based system, you can use Install-dep.sh to install the dependencies for you. This file will use `sudo apt` and `pip` to download and install dependencies for you. You will need sudo privileges to use this script.

Use ./Install-dep.sh
If got a error use sudo chmod a+x Install-dep.sh
The rest is in readme.
